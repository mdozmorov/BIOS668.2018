## GitHub assignment submission instructions

- All assignments and the final project should be submitted as reproducible reports in RMarkdown. Reproducibility is defined as error-free `knit`ting of the report on any computer.

- Download and install git and create an account on `github.com`. Choose a professional-sounding username!
- Create a folder on your computer for this class, e.g. "Users/name/Documents/coursework/biosXYZ/". Create 2 subfolders: "materials" and "responses".
- In Terminal, go to "/materials/" and type `git clone https://github.com/mdozmorov/BIOS692.2018`. This will give you access to all course material posted during the semester
- Sign into our virtual classroom at `https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/35034451-bios668-2018` and create a repository with your name or github username followed by "-hw", e.g. "jdoe-hw".
- In Terminal, go to "/responses/" and initialise a git repository (your local repository) named as in the in github classroom (your remote repository). Add the remote repository to your local repository.
- Read http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html, https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6143285/git-add-vs-push-vs-commit
- For a given homework, create a folder `hwX`, where `X` is the number of the homework
- Add the homework material to that folder, commit and push it to your classroom repository. Limit your homework material to self-contained code files, i.e., any data should be either downloaded via the code ot described how to prepare. NEVER commit binary files and large data files!
- The repositories on github classroom are private, so your classmates cannot see your solution (but the instructor can). You should practice adding, committing and pushing your homework as you work (e.g. as you finish each question) to get into good habits!
