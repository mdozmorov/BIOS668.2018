<!--Single gene disorders or complex traits. A single rare mutation can fully account for a Mendelian disease; clinical variability can be, however, observed even for determined monogenic disease, and this variability may itself involve genetic factors, the so-called modifier genes. In contrast to monogenic traits, complex traits have many contributing genes and non-genetic influences.-->

## Heredity

- Traits are passed from parents to children
- Some traits tend to dominate other traits
- **Allele** - alternative forms of a gene 
- Simplifying assumption: some traits are all-or-nothing. E.g. eye color - one allele (b) is for blue eyes, another allele (B) is for brown eyes
    - **Bb** - heterozygous
    - **bb** - homozygous

- **Genotype** - what alleles you have
- **Phenotype** - what traits you have 
- **HERITABILITY** - the proportion of the variation in a given characteristic or state that can be attributed to (additive) genetic factors.

<!--
Say, brown eyes allele is dominant, blue is recessive.

- **Bb** - brown eyes - homozygous dominant
- **bB** - brown eyes - homozygous dominant
- **BB** - brown eyes - homozygous dominant
- **bb** - blue eyes - heterozygous hybrid

## Punnett square 

|   |  B |  b |
|:-:|:--:|:--:|
| B | BB | Bb |
| b | Bb | bb |

- Many different genotypes correspond to the same phenotype
- Two hybrids produce blue-eyed offsprings with 25% probability
- Two hybrids produce heterozygous offsprings with 50% probability

## Fun with Punnett square

- Mom: BB
- Dad: Bb

|   |  B |  B |
|:-:|:--:|:--:|
| B | BB | BB |
| b | Bb | bB |

- Blue eyes - **bb** - 0%
- Heterozygous dominant - **Bb** - 50%

## Incomplete dominance

- Red flower
- White flower

|   | R  | W  |
|---|----|----|
| R | RR | RW |
| W | RW | WW |

Mixing (blending) of traits. E.g., RW - pink

## Blood types

A B O

O - recessive, A and B are codominant

|   | A  | B  |
|---|----|----|
| A | AA | AB |
| O | AO | BO |

AB - AB blood type

P(A blood type) = AA and AO = 50%

## Independent assortment 

If alleles are on different chromosomes, one allele is said to be independent on another 

- b - blue eyes
- B - brown eyes (dominant)
- t - small nose
- T - big nose (dominant)

BbTT - brown eyes, big nose

## Independent assortment 

Parents: both are dihybrids BbTt

|    | BT   | Bt   | bT   | bt   |
|----|------|------|------|------|
| BT | BTBT | BTBt | BTbT | BTbt |
| Bt | BtBT | BtBt | BtbT | Btbt |
| bT | bTBT | bTBt | bTbT | bTbt |
| bt | btBT | btBt | btbT | btbt |

- Brown eyes, big nose - 9
- Brown eyes, small nose - 3
- Blue eyes, big nose - 3
- Blue eyes, small nose - 1 (1/16)

## Hardy-Weinberg principle (1908)

## Hardy-Weinberg principle (1908)

Given a population with a locus with two alleles and discrete generations and these assumptions:

- The population is infinitely large
- There is no mutation
- There is no immigration or emigration
- There are no differences among the genotypes in viability
- There are no differences among the genotypes in fertility
- There are no differences in frequencies of genotypes between females and males

then if we start with genotype frequencies, we can calculate the frequencies of the genotypes in the next generation

## Modeling allele sampling with the binomial distribution

- The binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of $n$ _independent_ _yes_ (e.g., "heads" or "reference allele") or _no_ (e.g., "tails" or "alternate allele") experiments, each of which yields success with probability $p$ 
- The probability of getting exactly $k$ successes in $n$ trials is given by the probability mass function:

$$Pr(X=k) = \binom{n}{k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$

\scriptsize

- What is the probability of seeing $k=1$ tails in $n=3$ flips of a fair coin with the probability of a tail $(p) = 0.5$?
- $3\ choose\ 1 = 3$; $0.5^1 = 0.5$; $(1-0.5)^{(3-1)} = 0.25$. So, $3*0.5*0.25 = 0.375$
- In R: `dbinom(1, size=3, prob=0.5)`

## Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

- The binomial distribution of genotypes in a population, such that frequencies of genotypes **AA**, **Aa** and **aa** will be $p^2$, $2pq$, and $q^2$, respectively, where $p$ is the frequency of allele **A**, and $q$ is the frequency of allele **a**. 
- Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium applies in a population when there are no factors such as migration or admixture that cause deviations from $p^2$, $2pq$ and $q^2$.

## Hardy-Weinberg principle

- Blue - **b**, $p$ - allele frequency of **b**
- Brown - **B** (dominant), $q$ - allele frequency of **B**

For two individuals **Bb** and **bb**, genotype frequency of **b** is 75%, frequency of **B** is 25%. Phenotype frequency for blue eyes - 50%, for brown eyes - 50%

$$p + q = 100\% = 1,\ q = 1 - p$$

$$p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$

- $p^2$ - probability of **bb** from both parents
- $q^2$ - probability of **BB** from both parents
- $2pq$ - two ways of have hybrid alleles **Bb** or **bB**. Frequency of hybrids in a population

<!--
## Hardy-Weinberg principle example

- 15 individuals in a population

| Phenotype | Counts | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| AA        | 7      | 7/15      |
| Aa        | 3      | 3/15      |
| aa        | 5      | 5/15      |

## Hardy-Weinberg principle example

$$f(AA) + f(Aa) + f(aa)$$
$$p^2 + 2p(1 - p) + (1 - p)^2$$

$p(A) = f(AA) + 1/2f(Aa) = 7/15 + 1/2*3/15 = 17/30 \simeq 0.57$

$p(a) = f(aa) + 1/2f(Aa) = 5/15 + 1/2*3/15 = 13/30 \simeq 0.43$
-->

## Hardy-Weinberg principle

- Say, population is 1M
- 9% have blue eyes. Must have $bb = p^2 = 0.9$, $p = \sqrt{0.9} = 0.3$
- 91% have brown eyes. What percent will be **BB**?
