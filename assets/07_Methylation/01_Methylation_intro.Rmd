## Epigenomics

- **Epigenomics** can be defined as the genome-wide investigation of stably heritable phenotypes resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence
- Term coined by Conrad Hal Waddington in 1942

## DNA methylation 

- DNA methylation is a type of chemical modification of DNA which involves the addition of a methyl group to the number 5 carbon of the cytosine (5C), to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine (5mC).
- The most well characterized epigenetic mechanism.
- In humans, DNA methylation occurs in cytosines that precede guanines (hence, CpG)
- Invertebrates (Drosophila, yeast) do not exhibit cytosine methylation

## DNA modifications  

- Other nucleotides (Adenine, Guanine, Thymine) can also be modified
- Mainly in bacteria, but genomes of eukaryotes may contain base modifications on bases other than cytosine, such as methylated adenine or guanine

## CpG Sites and CpG islands

- CpG sites are not randomly distributed in the genome - the frequency of CpG sites in human genomes is 1% (~28 million CpGs), which is less than the expected (~4-6%). 
- Around 60-90% of CpGs are methylated in mammals. 
- DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and may help to suppress transcription from these sequences, and aid chromosomal stability. 

## CpG Sites and CpG islands

- There are regions of the DNA that have a higher concentration of CpG sites (> 60%), named the CpG islands, which tend to be located in the promoter regions of many genes.
- Between 200-1000 bp in length
- Usually not methylated.
- Less than 10% of CpGs occur in CG-dense regions

## non-CG methylation

- Embryonic stem cells have ~25% of non-CG methylation (mCHG and mCHH, where H=A, C, T). 
- non-CG methylation correlates with gene expression in ESCs. 
- non-CG methylation is on anti-sense strand of gene bodies, and correlates with increased _intronic_ transcription in ESCs.
- non-CG methylation is depleted in ehancers in ESCs.

## Creation and maintenance of DNA methylation

- In humans, DNA is methylated by three enzymes, DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b.
- DNMT1 is the maintenance methyltransferase that is responsible for copying DNA methylation patterns to the daughter strands during DNA replication. 
- DNMT3a and 3b are the _de novo_ methyltransferases that, in combination with DNMT3L, set up DNA methylation patterns early in development. 

## Removal of DNA methylation

- Loss of 5mC can be achieved **passively** by dilution during replication or exclusion of DNMT1 from the nucleus. 
- Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family of proteins can **actively** convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in vertebrates - demethylation
- Iterative oxidations of 5hmC catalysed by TET result in 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). 5caC mark is excised from DNA by G/T mismatch-specific thymine-DNA glycosylase (TDG), which as a result returns cytosine residue back to its unmodified state

## Roles of DNA methylation

- Transcriptional gene silencing
- Maintain genome stability
- Embryonic development
- Genomic imprinting
- X chromosome inactivation (females)

## Factors associated with changes in DNA methylation

- Aging (developmental stage)
- Diet
- Inflammatory patterns
- Environmental exposures
- Smoking
- Alcohol

## DNA methylation and cancer

**Hypomethylation** – decrease methylation levels

- A lower level of DNA methylation in tumors was one of the first epigenetic alterations to be found in human cancer. (Feinberg AP, et al., 1983). 
- Demethylation of the promoter region of proto-oncogenes will activate normally repressed gene expression
- Global hypomethylation of DNA sequences that are normally heavily methylated may result in:
    - Chromosomal instability 
    - Increased transcription from transposable elements 
    - An elevated mutation rate due to mitotic recombination

## DNA hypermethylation

**Hypermethylation** – increase methylation levels

- Hypermethylation of the CpG islands in the promoter regions of tumor-suppressor genes is a major event in the origin of many cancers.
- Hypermethylation of promoters can inactivate tumor-suppressor genes, affect genes involved in the cell cycle, DNA repair, and the metabolism of carcinogens, all of which are involved in the development of cancer. 
- The profiles of hypermethylation of the CpG islands in tumor-suppressor genes are specific to the cancer type.

## Application of DNA methylation assays

**Early diagnosis**

- Detection of CpG-island hypermethylation in biological fluids and serum

**Prognosis**

- Hypemethylation of specific genes
- Whole DNA methylation profiles

**Prediction**

- CpG island hypermethylation as a marker of response to chemotherapy

**Prevention**

- Developing DNMTs inhibitors as chemopreventive drugs to reactive silenced genes
