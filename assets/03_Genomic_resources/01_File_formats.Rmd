# Sequencing data ecosystem

## The reference genome as a coordinate system

\includegraphics[height=70px]{img/genomic_coordinates.png}

## Binary and "plain text" files

**"Plain text" ("flat") file formats**  

- Information often structured into lines and columns
- Human-readable, processable with simple command-line tools
- Space is often saved through the means of archiving (e.g. zip) and human-readable information coding (e.g. flags)

**Binary file formats**  

- Not human-readable (not intended for reading)
- Require special software for processing (programs intended for plain text processing will not work properly on them, e.g. `wc`, `grep`)
- Efficient storage, (significant) reduction to file size when compared to a plain text counterpart (e.g. 75 % space saved)

## Some common file formats

- **FASTA** - Simple collections of named DNA/protein sequences (text)
- **FASTQ** - Extension of FASTA format, contains additional quality information. Widely used for storing unaligned sequencing reads (text)
- **SAM/BAM** - Alignments of sequencing reads to a reference genome (text/binary)
- **BED** - Region-based genome annotation information (e.g. a list of genes and their genomic locations). Used for visualization or simple enumeration (text)
- **GFF/GTF** - gene-centric annotations (text)
- **(big)WIG** - continuous signal representation (text, binary)
- **VCF** - variant call format, to store information about genomic variants (text)

## FASTA format

- Origin in 1980’s FASTP/FASTA software packages for sequence similarity searching
- Convenient format for storing/transferring simple sequence collections
- Intended for both, nucleotide and protein sequences (FAST- A, "Fast-All")
- Common output format of sequence databases –  Input format for various tools

## FASTA format

Each sequence entry consists of:  

- _a single line_ with sequence metadata, starting with the "greater-than" symbol (">")
- _any number of lines_ representing the actual sequence

```
A --> adenosine           M --> A C (amino)
C --> cytidine            S --> G C (strong)
G --> guanine             W --> A T (weak)
T --> thymidine           B --> G T C

Y --> T C (pyrimidine)    V --> G C A
K --> G T (keto)          N --> A G C T (any)
                          -  gap of indeterminate length
```

## Low-complexity regions

- Approximately 45% of the human genome can currently be recognized as being derived from transposable elements
- The majority are non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, such as LINE-1 (L1), Alu and SVA elements
- Other low-complexity biases: CG- and AT-rich DNA
- Represented by lower-case letters

Separator\ \ \ \ \ \ \ ```+```   
Quality\ scores\ \ \ ```!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65```    

\tiny https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format

## Sequence ID

\includegraphics[height=200px]{img/seqid.png}

## FASTQ quality scores (Phred scores)

**PHRED Base quality (Q)** – integer value derived from the estimated probability (P) of the corresponding base being determined wrong

$Q = -10*log_{10}(P_{err})$ (rounded to nearest integer)

- The _Ph_ in Phred comes from Phil Green, the inventor of the encoding
- P might be computed in different ways, depending on the sequencing platform, but the meaning of Q remains the same

## FASTQ quality scores (Phred scores)

**PHRED Base quality (Q)** – integer value derived from the estimated probability (P) of the corresponding base being determined wrong

-  A higher quality score is better (>=20 is considered "good")

\includegraphics[height=100px]{img/phred_table.png}

## ASCII table

\includegraphics[height=180px]{img/ascii-chars-table-landscape.png}

$$ASCII(char) = Q + 33$$

\tiny http://www.asciicharstable.com/_site_media/ascii/ascii-chars-table-landscape.pdf

##  Older FASTQ has had different encoding schemes for encoding PHRED quality scores.

\includegraphics[height=70px]{img/fastq_quality_encoding.png}

- Phred + 33 is currently used

## FASTQC - quality control

## The Sequence Alignment/Map format (SAM)

- Intended for storing read alignments against reference sequences
- Has a binary version with good software support (BAM format)

The SAM format consists of two sections: 

**Header section**

- Used to describe source of data, reference sequence, method of alignment, etc.

**Alignment section**

- Used to describe the read, quality of the read, and nature alignment of the read to a region of the genome

\tiny SAM format specification https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

## BAM file format of aligned data

- BAM is the binary version of a SAM file. Smaller, but not easily readable.
- Compressed using lossless BGZF format
- Other BAM compression strategies are a subject of research. See ‘CRAM’ format for example

\tiny http://www.internationalgenome.org/faq/what-are-cram-files/

## BAM file format of aligned data

- BAM files are usually indexed. An index is stored alongside the BAM file with a ".bai" extension
- Indexing aims to achieve fast retrieval of alignments overlapping a specified region without going through the whole alignments.
- BAM must be sorted before indexing. Depending on the downstream tools, sort by 
    - Name
    - Coordinate

## SAM example

\includegraphics[height=200px]{img/sam_example.png}

## SAM/BAM header section

- Used to describe source of data, reference sequence, method of alignment, etc.
- Each section begins with ‘@’ followed by a two-letter record type code. These are followed by two-letter tags and values

\small

```
@HD The header line
VN: format version
SO: Sorting order of alignments
@SQ Reference sequence dictionary
SN: reference sequence name
LN: reference sequence length
SP: species
@RG Read group
ID: read group identifier
CN: name of sequencing center
SM: sample name
@PG Program
PN: program name
VN: program version
```

## SAM/BAM alignment section

\includegraphics[height=120px]{img/sam_alignment.png}

\tiny https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

## Using SAM flags to filter subsets of reads

- 12 bitwise flags describing the alignment
- "Bitwise" – values contributing to the sum are powers of two (each can be represented by a single positive bit in a binary number)
- These flags are stored as a binary string of length 11
- Value of "1" indicates the flag is set. e.g. 00100000000
- All combinations can be represented as a number from 1 to 2048 (i.e. $2^{11}-1$). This number is used in the BAM/SAM file. You can specify "required" or "filter" flags in `samtools view` command using the `-f` and `-F` options, respectively

## Using SAM flags to filter subsets of reads

- Unambiguous – there is exactly one possible decomposition of each FLAG sum 
- Each value contributing to the sum represents one fulfilled condition

\includegraphics[height=120px]{img/sam_flags.png}

\tiny https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/explain-flags.html

https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

## SAM – bitwise FLAG (example)

\includegraphics[height=185px]{img/flag_example.png}

## SAM – bitwise FLAG (example)

FLAG 83  

- Binary numbers: FLAG 1010011 is a sum of 1000000, 10000, 10 and 1
    - Easy to break down, but binary numbers are long  
- In decimal numbers: FLAG 83 is a sum of 64, 16, 2 and 1
    - 83 = 64 + 19 = 64 + (16 + 3) = 64 + 16 + (2 + 1)  
- What does FLAG 83 mean?

\includegraphics[height=35px]{img/flag_example1.png}

## CIGAR string

\includegraphics[height=100px]{img/sam_cigar.png}

- The CIGAR string is a sequence of base lengths and associated "operations" that are used to indicate which bases align to the reference (either a match or mismatch), are deleted, are inserted, represent introns, etc.
    - e.g. 81M859N19M
    - Read as: A 100 bp read consists of: 81 bases of alignment to reference, 859 bases skipped (an intron), 19 bases of alignment

## BED format

- Text-based, tab-separated list of genomic regions
- Each region is specified by a reference sequence and the start and end positions on it
- Optionally, each region can have additional properties defined –  E.g. strand, name, score, color
- Intended for visualizing genomic annotations in IGV, UCSC Genome Browser (context of expression, regulation, variation, conservation, ...)

\tiny http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1

## BED format

3 mandatory columns (must be in correct order)  

- "chrom" – chromosome
- "chromStart" – the first base of the region with respect to the chromosome (counting starts from 0)
- "chromEnd" – the first base after the region with respect to the chromosome
- [chromStart, chromEnd) allows easy region-length calculation
- Optional fields: "name", "score", "strand", other annotation columns

\small

```

````

## BED format – optional fields

- 9 additional optional fields, their order is binding (unlike with SAM format). If n optional fields are included, they will be considered to be the first n optional fields from the format specification
- All regions must have the same optional fields (unlike with SAM format)

Most important optional fields:  

- "name" – name of the region
- "score" – score value between 0 and 1000 (read-count, transformed p-value, "quality", ...)
- Can be interpreted as shades of grey during visualization
- "strand" – either "+" or "-" (not "1"/"-1")
- BED12 format specification available

- variable step format - for data with irregular intervals 
```
variableStep  chrom=chrN
[span=windowSize]
  chromStartA  dataValueA

## VCF format

- Variant Call Format (VCF) is a flexible and extendable format for variation data 

\includegraphics[height=160px]{img/vcf_format1.png}

## VCF format

- CHROMO: chromosome / contig
- POS: the reference position with the 1st base having position 1
    - The value in POS refers to the position of the first base in the string. For indels, the reference string must include the base before the event (and this must be reflected in POS)
- ID: an id; rs number if dbSNP variant
- REF: reference base
- ALT: comma sepearated list of alternate non-ref alleles called on at least one of the samples
    - If no alternate alleles then the missing value should be used “.”
- QUAL: phred-scaled quality score of the assertion made in ALT (whether variant or non-variant)
- FILTER: PASS if the position has passed all filters (defined in meta-data)
- INFO: additional information

## VCF Format

## Mutation Annotation Format (MAF)

- Tab-delimited
- In the context of human cancer, MAF files come in two types--protected and somatic
    - TCGA Protected MAFs include all sequenced mutations for the given technique, and these are further classified as either somatic mutations or other mutations grouped under germline mutations
    - TCGA Somatic MAFs retain mutations validated in a secondary assay to ensure it is not due to sequencing error and of those that remain unvalidated retain mutations within protein coding regions or splice sites. All other mutations are filtered out

https://www.biostars.org/p/69222/

https://github.com/mskcc/vcf2maf

## Formats use different coordinate systems

- **BED**: 0-based, half-open 
- **GFF**: 1-based, closed 
- **SAM**: 1-based, closed 
- **BAM**: 0-based, half-open
- **VCF**: 1-based, closed

\includegraphics[height=65px]{img/bed_coordinates.jpg}

\tiny https://www.biostars.org/p/84686/

## Formats use different chromosome naming conventions

- The UCSC and Ensembl databases name their chromosomes differently. 
- By convention, UCSC chromosomes start with chr while Ensembl chromosome names do not.
- UCSC will call the fifth chromosome chr5 and Ensembl will call it 5
