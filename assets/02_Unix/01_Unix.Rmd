## What is Unix

- Unix is a family of operating systems and environments that exploits the power of linguistic abstractions to perform tasks
- Unix is not an acronym; it is a pun on "Multics". Multics was a large multi-user operating system that was being developed at Bell Labs shortly before Unix was created in the early '70s. Brian Kernighan is credited with the name.
- All computational genomics is done in Unix

## History of Unix

- Initial file system, command interpreter (shell), and process management started by Ken Thompson
- File system and further development from Dennis Ritchie, as well as Doug McIlroy and Joe Ossanna
- Vast array of simple, dependable tools that each do one simple task

## Philosophy of Unix

- Vast array of simple, dependable tools
- Each do one simple task, and do it really well
- By combining these tools, one can conduct rather sophisticated analyses

## Know your Unix

- Unix users spend a lot of time at the **command line**
- In Unix, a word is worth a thousand mouse clicks

## Unix systems

- Three common types of laptop/desktop operating systems: Windows, Mac, Linux.
- Mac and Linux are both Unix-like!
- What that means for us: Unix-like operating systems are equipped with "shells"" that provide a command line user interface.

## What is shell

- Shell is an interactive environment with a set of commands to initiate and direct computations
- Shell encloses the complexity of OS, hence the name  
    - You type in commands 
    - Shell executes them

\tiny https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell

## Command line, aka shell

- The Bourne shell (`sh`) is a shell, or command-line interpreter, for computer operating systems.
- Developed by Stephen Bourne at Bell Labs, 1976
- `bash` (the Bourne-Again shell) was later developed for the GNU project and incorporates features from the Bourne shell, `csh`, and `ksh`. It is meant to be POSIX-compliant.

\tiny https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne

## Most popular types of shell

- `bash` - Bourne-Again shell
- `tcsh` - TENEX C shell
- `zsh` - Z shell
- Change shell: `chsh –s /bin/zsh`
- `$SHELL` environmental variable has path to the currently used shell

## Getting to the command line

- Remote access, SSH, **PuTTY** (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), **MobaXterm** (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/)
- **Mac OS X + Xcode development suite** (free, https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) + **X11 server** (free, https://www.xquartz.org/) + **iTerm2** (optional, https://iterm2.com/)
- **Ubuntu Linux** (long-term support LTS version, XX.04, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

## Getting to the command line | Windows users  

- **Cygwin**, http://www.cygwin.com/
- **Git Bash**, https://git-for-windows.github.io/ 
- Boot from a CD or USB
- Install the whole Linux systems as a Virtual Machine in **VirtualBox** (https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## Obtaining new command-line software

- Modern Unix systems have package managers to that download install (free) software for you
- On a Mac, **Homebrew** (http://brew.sh/) is a popular package-management system (alternatively, **MacPorts**, https://www.macports.org/)
- On Ubuntu, **apt** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Packaging_Tool) is the standard package manager, with both a command-line and graphical interface available
- On Windows, **Cygwin** (https://cygwin.com/install.html) installs everything precompiled through its setup file. Do not delete `setup-x86_64.exe` file after installing Cygwin, explore what Linux tools are available (a lot)

## Interacting with shell

- Most commands take additional arguments that fine tune their behavior
- If you don't know what a command does, use the command `man <command>`
- Press `q` to quit the `man` page viewer
- Most often, you’ll use `<command> -h` or `<command> --help`
- Some commands output help if executed without any arguments

## File system: Full vs. relative paths

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=100px]{img/file_paths.png}
\end{center}

- `cd /` - go to the root directory
- `cd /usr/home/jack/bin` - go to the user’s sub-directory
- `cd ..` - go to the upper level directory
- `cd`, or `cd ~` - go to the user’s home directory
- `cd --` - go to the last visited directory

## Orienting in the filesystem

- `pwd` 		- print working directory
- `ls` 			- list all files in the current directory
- `ls -1` 	- list files in _one_ column
- `ls –lah`	- list files in `l`ong, `h`uman readable format, include `a`ll content, user, owner, permissions

## Creating, moving, copying, and removing files

- `touch <file>` - creates an empty file
- `nano <file>` - edit it
- `mkdir <dirname>` - creates a directory
- `cp <source_file> <target_file>` - copy a file to another location/file
- `mv <source_file> <target_file>` - move a file
- `rm <file>` - remove a file. If multiple files provided, removes all of them
- `rm –r <dirname>` - recursive removal (deletes a directory)

## Permissions: `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`

In Unix, every file and directory has an **owner** and a **group**  

- `Owner` - is the one who created a file/directory
- `Group` - defines rules of file operations and/or permissions
- `Every` - user on a Unix machine can belong to one or more groups

Every file has **three permission levels**   

- what the **u**ser can do
- what the **g**roup can do
- what the **a**ll can do

## Permissions: `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`

- The first column tells you about the permissions on the file  
    - The very first character in the permissions column tells you what kind of file it is. A `-` means it's a regular file. A `d` means it's a directory
    - The next nine characters come in three classes, each has three characters. The three classes are `owner`/`group`/`world` permissions
    - Inside a permission class, `r` means that class can **r**ead the file; `w` means that class can **w**rite the file; `x` means that class can e**x**ecute the file

- The second column has the number of files (inside a directory)
- The third and fourth columns tell you the owner and group

## Permissions: `chmod`, `chown` and `chgrp`

## Finding your files

- `find` - lists all files under the working directory (and its subdirectories) based on arbitrary criteria
- `find .` - prints the name of every file or directory, recursively. Starts from the current directory
- `find . –type f` - finds files only
- `find . –type d –maxdepth 1` - finds directories only, at most 1 level down
- `find . –type f –name "*.mp3"` - finds only *.mp3 files
- `find . -type f -name "README.md" -exec wc -l {} \;` - find files and execute a command on them

## Wildcards and patterns

- `*` - matches any character
- `?` - matches a single character
- `[chars]` - matches any character in chars
- `[a-zA-Z]` - matches any character between `a` and `z`, including capital letters

- `ls *.md`
- `ls [Rt]*`

## Looking inside files

- `cat <file>` - prints out content of a file. If multiple files, consequently prints out all of them (concatenates)
- `zcat` - prints out content of gzipped files
- `more/less <file>` - shows the content of the file one screen at a time

**Keyboard shortcuts for more command**  

- `space` - forward
- `b` - backward
- `g` - go to the beginning
- `G` - go to the end
- `/<text>` - starts forward search, enter to find next instance
- `q` - quit

## Chaining commands: pipes

One of the most useful capabilities of Unix is the ability to redirect the STDOUT of one command into the STDIN of another

The `|` (pipe) character feeds output from the first program (to the left of the `|`) as input to the second program on the right. Therefore, you can string all sorts of commands together using the pipe

```
find . | wc -l
cat names.txt | sort | uniq -c
```

Executing one command AFTER another completed successfully: `<command> && <command>`

```
mkdir music && mv *.mp3 music/
```

## Chaining commands: redirections

- Nearly every command in Unix makes use of a convention to have a "standard input" (also called stdin or STDIN, or channel 0) and "standard output" (also called stdout or STDOUT, or channel 1)
- There is also a "standard error" (stderr or STDERR, or channel 2) output that is, by convention, reserved for error messages

- `find / 2> error.log` - capture STDERR into a file
- `find / 2> /dev/null` - suppress STDERR messages
- `find / 2>&1` - add STDERR to STDOUT

## Chaining commands: redirections

- If you want to dump the standard output into a file, use `command > file` (overwrites the file). `command >> file` (appends to the file)
- Redirection example: `ls > README.md` - save file list in the current directory into README.md file
- Redirection works in another direction: `grep CC0 < License.md`
- Or, the content of a commant into another command: `join <(sort file1) <(sort file2)`

## Other essential commands

|  |       |
|-----------|----------|
| head/tail | cut      |
| for       | comm     |
| sort      | echo     |
| uniq      | basename |
| wc        | dirname  |
| tr        | history  |
| grep      | which    |
| join      | who      |
| kill      | grep     |

## Shell conveniences

- Tab completion
- `Ctrl-c` - cancel the command you are writing
- `Ctrl-r` - reverse search through your command line history
- `history` - shows your previous commands
- `!<history number>` - repeats specific command
- `!!` - repeats the last command

## Statistical command line goodies

- **data_hacks**, https://github.com/bitly/data_hacks
    - Command line tools for data analysis
    - `histogram.py`
    - `bar_chart.py`
    - `sample.py`

- **datamash**, https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/
    - summary statistics
    - transposing matrixes

## Unix for high-performance cluster computing

- Allow you to submit multiple jobs at once
- Depending on the system, can schedule jobs for you
- Are optimized for high-throughput performance

## Unix at VCU

- VCU Biostatistics cluster information, https://wiki.vcu.edu/display/biosit/Home
- Contact Helen Wang (huwang at vcu.edu) to establish an account
- Google if you run into problems using Unix!

## Move files over the network

**scp**: securely copy a file from one computer to another
 
 - Use `scp` to securely transfer files between two Unix computers
 - No need to start an FTP session of logging into the remote system explicityl
 - The scp command uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication
 - `scp` encrypts both the file and any passwords exchanged
 - Alternatively, use `rsync`
 
The syntax for the scp command is:
```
scp [options] username1@source_host:directory1/filename1 username2@destination_host:directory2/filename2
```
 
## scp examples
 
- Copy remote file locally (in the current folder)
```
scp mdozmorov@merlot.bis.vcu.edu:sequencing/hg38.Ensembl.gtf .
```
- Copy local file remotely
```
scp hg38.Ensembl.gtf mdozmorov@merlot.bis.vcu.edu:sequencing/
```
- Use `-r` (recursive) option to copy a directory
- Explore `rsync` command as an alternative to `scp`
